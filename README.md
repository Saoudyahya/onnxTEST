# PyTorch Simple Model to ONNX Export

This project demonstrates how to define a simple neural network using PyTorch and export it to the ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) format. The ONNX format allows models to be shared and used across different frameworks and platforms.

## Features
- Defines a simple feedforward neural network.
- Exports the model to the ONNX format for interoperability.
- Includes a dummy input for testing the export process.

## Requirements
To run this code, you need:
- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch
- ONNX

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch onnx
